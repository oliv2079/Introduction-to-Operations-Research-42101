Project 1: Done

  Note: There is a mistake in Exercise 4. I just noticed that I have forgotten to take into account the travel time from going from the end location of one trip to the start location of another as well as the 15 minute break before the beginning of a new trip. So doing trip 2 after trip 4 would be impossible for example. This was not taken into account in my solution to the problem
